# Comments

Comments are line of code that the javascript interpreter will not execute. This is useful mostly for documenting pieces of code or debugging.

Single-line comments	

{% runkit %}
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
//var c = a + b;
{% endrunkit %}

Multi-line comments

{% runkit %}
/*var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var c = a + b;*/
{% endrunkit %}
